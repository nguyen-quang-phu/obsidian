title: Load Balancing Algorithms Explained with Code (and Visuals)
---
Load balancing is the process of **distributing incoming network traffic** across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5215d10-fcd8-4c50-acb6-ccbb36dea24f_832x1000.png)

By evenly spreading the workload, load balancing aims to **prevent overload** on a single server, **enhance performance** by reducing response times and **improve availability** by rerouting traffic in case of server failures.

There are several algorithms to achieve load balancing, each with its pros and cons.

In this article, we will dive into the most commonly used load balancing algorithms, how they work, when to use them, their benefits/drawbacks and how to implement them in code.

1. A request is sent to the first server in the list.
2. The next request is sent to the second server, and so on.
3. After the last server in the list, the algorithm loops back to the first server.

- When all servers have similar processing capabilities and are equally capable of handling requests.
- When simplicity and even distribution of load is more critical.

- Simple to implement and understand.
- Ensures even distribution of traffic.

- Does not consider server load or response time.
- Can lead to inefficiencies if servers have different processing capabilities.

**[Code Link](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/blob/main/implementations/python/load_balancing_algorithms/round_robin.py.py)**

In this implementation, the `RoundRobin` class maintains a **list of servers** and keeps track of the **current index**.

The `get_next_server()` updates the index and returns the next server in the cycle.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb12546e-4905-46b0-89e6-80ab007a6aa2_1570x1110.png)

1. Each server is assigned a **weight** based on their processing power or available resources.
2. Servers with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of incoming requests.

- When servers have different processing capabilities or available resources.
- When you want to distribute the load based on the capacity of each server.

- Balances load according to server capacity.
- More efficient use of server resources.

- Slightly more complex to implement than simple Round Robin.
- Does not consider current server load or response time.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c138f0a-d1e6-463d-be1f-dfa06cb8a402_3060x2528.png)

**[Code Link](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/blob/main/implementations/python/load_balancing_algorithms/weighted_round_robin.py)**

In this implementation, the `WeightedRoundRobin` class takes a list of servers and their corresponding weights.

The `get_next_server()` method runs an infinite loop to find a suitable server based on the weights, ensuring that servers with higher weights receive more requests.

The algorithm keeps track of the current weight and adjusts it in each iteration to maintain the desired distribution ratio.

**Example:** if the weights are `[5, 1, 1]`, Server 1 will be selected 5 times more often than Server 2 or Server 3.

1. Monitor the **number of active connections** on each server.
2. Assigns incoming requests to the server with the least number of active connections.

- When you want to distribute the load based on the current number of active connections.
- When servers have similar processing capabilities but may have different levels of concurrent connections.

- Balances load more dynamically based on current server load.
- Helps prevent any server from becoming overloaded with a high number of active connections.

- May not be optimal if servers have different processing capabilities.
- Requires tracking active connections for each server.

**[Code Link](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/blob/main/implementations/python/load_balancing_algorithms/least_connections.py)**

In this example, the `LeastConnections` class maintains a map of servers and the number of active connections for each server.

The `get_next_server()` method selects a random server with the least number of connections and increments the connection count for that server.

The `release_connection()` method is called when a connection is closed, decrementing the connection count for the corresponding server.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13178f62-358e-4717-83e9-f404bf9f91e5_1710x1120.png)

- Monitors the response time of each server
- Assigns incoming requests to the server with the fastest response time.

- When you have servers with varying response times and want to route requests to the fastest server.

- Minimizes overall latency by selecting the server with the fastest response time.
- Can adapt dynamically to changes in server response times.
- Helps improve the user experience by providing quick responses.

- Requires accurate measurement of server response times, which can be challenging in distributed systems.
- May not consider other factors such as server load or connection count.

**[Code Link](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/blob/main/implementations/python/load_balancing_algorithms/least_response_time.py)**

In this example, the `LeastResponseTime` class maintains a list of servers and keeps track of the response time for each server.

The `get_next_server()` method selects the server with the least response time. The `update_response_time()` method is called after each request to update the response time for the corresponding server.

To simulate the response time, we use a `simulate_response_time()` function that introduces a random delay to mimic the server's response time.

In a real-world scenario, you would measure the actual response time of each server.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc38a5648-bcdf-487c-9fe6-a0a179eb5f72_1304x1098.png)

- Calculates a hash value from the client’s IP address and uses it to determine the server to route the request.

- When you need session persistence, as requests from the same client are always directed to the same server.

- Simple to implement.
- Useful for applications that require sticky sessions.

- Can lead to uneven load distribution if certain IP addresses generate more traffic than others.
- Lacks flexibility if a server goes down, as the hash mapping may need to be reconfigured.

**[Code Link](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-system-design-resources/blob/main/implementations/python/load_balancing_algorithms/ip_hash.py)**

In this implementation, the `IPHash` class takes a list of servers.

The `get_next_server()` method calculates the MD5 hash of the client's IP address and uses the modulo operator to determine the index of the server to which the request should be routed.

This ensures that **requests from the same IP address are always directed to the same server.**

- **Round Robin**: Simple and even distribution, best for homogeneous servers.
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Distributes based on server capacity, good for heterogeneous environments.
- **Least Connections**: Dynamically balances based on load, ideal for varying workloads.
- **Least Response Time**: Optimizes for fastest response, best for environments with varying server performance.
- **IP Hash**: Ensures session persistence, useful for stateful applications.

Choosing the right load balancing algorithm depends on the specific needs and characteristics of your system, including server capabilities, workload distribution, and performance requirements.
