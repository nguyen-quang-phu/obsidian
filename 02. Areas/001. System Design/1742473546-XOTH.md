# Put Back-of-the-envelope Numbers in Perspective

- Why do we use back-of-the-envelope calculations?

  - A distributed system has compute nodes connected via a network. There’s a wide variety of available compute nodes and they can be connected in many different ways. Back-of-the-envelope calculations help us ignore the nitty-gritty details of the system (at least at the design level) and focus on more important aspects.

- Some examples of a back-of-the-envelope calculation could be:
  - The number of concurrent TCP connections a server can support.
  - The number of requests per second (RPS) a web, database, or cache server can handle.
  - The storage requirements of a service.

- Choosing an unreasonable number for such calculations can lead to a flawed design. Since we need good estimations in many design problems, we’ll discuss all the relevant concepts in detail in this lesson. These concepts include:
  - The types of data center servers.
  - The realistic access latencies of different components.
  - The estimation of RPS that a server can handle.
  - Examples of bandwidth, servers, and storage estimation.

- Types of data center servers
  - Data centers don’t have a single type of server. Enterprise solutions use commodity hardware to save cost and develop scalable solutions. Below, we discuss the types of servers that are commonly used within a data center to handle different workloads.

  - Web servers
    - For scalability, the web servers are decoupled from the application servers. Web servers are the first point of contact after load balancers. Data centers have racks full of web servers that usually handle API calls from the clients. Depending on the service that’s offered, the memory and storage resources in web servers can be small to medium. However, such servers require good computational resources. For example, Facebook has used a web server with 32 GB of RAM and 500 GB of storage space. But for its high-end computational needs, it partnered with Intel to build a custom 16-core processor.
