# Examples of Resource Estimation

- Introduction
  - Now that we’ve set the foundation for resource estimation, let’s make use of our background knowledge to estimate resources like servers, storage, and bandwidth. Below, we consider a scenario and a service, make assumptions, and based on those assumptions, we make estimations. Let’s jump right in!
