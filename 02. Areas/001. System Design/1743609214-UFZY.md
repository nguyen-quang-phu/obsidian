# Static versus dynamic algorithms
Algorithms can be static or dynamic depending on the machine’s state. Let’s look at each of the categories individually:

- Static algorithms don’t consider the changing state of the servers. Therefore, task assignment is carried out based on existing knowledge about the server’s configuration. Naturally, these algorithms aren’t complex, and they get implemented in a single router or commodity machine where all the requests arrive.

- Dynamic algorithms are algorithms that consider the current or recent state of the servers. Dynamic algorithms maintain state by communicating with the server, which adds a communication overhead. State maintenance makes the design of the algorithm much more complicated.

- Dynamic algorithms require different load balancing servers to communicate with each other to exchange information. Therefore, dynamic algorithms can be modular because no single entity will do the decision-making. Although this adds complexity to dynamic algorithms, it results in improved forwarding decisions. Finally, dynamic algorithms monitor the health of the servers and forward requests to active servers only.
