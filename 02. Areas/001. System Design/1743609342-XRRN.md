# Types of load balancers

- Depending on the requirements, load balancing can be performed at the network/transport and application layer of the open systems interconnection (OSI) layers.

  - Layer 4 load balancers: Layer 4 refers to the load balancing performed on the basis of transport protocols like TCP and UDP. These types of LBs maintain connection/session with the clients and ensure that the same (TCP/UDP) communication ends up being forwarded to the same back-end server. Even though TLS termination is performed at layer 7 LBs, some layer 4 LBs also support it.
  - Layer 7 load balancers: Layer 7 load balancers are based on the data of application layer protocols. It’s possible to make application-aware forwarding decisions based on HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and other application-specific data—for example, user ID. Apart from performing TLS termination, these LBs can take responsibilities like rate limiting users, HTTP routing, and header rewriting.
