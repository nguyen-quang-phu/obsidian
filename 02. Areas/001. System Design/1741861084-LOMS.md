# Availability

- What is availability?
  - Availability is the percentage of time that some service or infrastructure is accessible to clients and is operated upon under normal conditions.
  - For example, if a service has 100% availability, it means that the said service functions and responds as intended (operates normally) all the time.

- Measuring availability
  - Mathematically, availability, A, is a ratio. The higher the A value, the better. We can also write this up as a formula:
  - A (in percent) = (Total Time −Amount Of Time Service Was Down)/ Total Time∗100
