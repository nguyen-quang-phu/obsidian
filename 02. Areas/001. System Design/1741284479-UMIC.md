- What is system design?
  - System design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements.
  - System design uses the concepts of computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to craft systems that scale well and are performant
  - System design aims to build systems that are reliable, effective, and maintainable, among other characteristics.
    - Reliable systems handle faults, failures, and errors.
    - Effective systems meet all user needs and business requirements.
    - Maintainable systems are flexible and easy to scale up or down. The ability to add new features also comes under the umbrella of maintainability.

- What is abstraction?
  - Abstraction is the art of obfuscating details that we don’t need. It allows us to concentrate on the big picture. 

- Database abstractions
  - Transactions is a database abstraction that hides many problematic outcomes when concurrent users are reading, writing, or mutating the data and gives a simple interface of commit, in case of success, or abort, in case of failure

- What is RPC?
  - RPC is an interprocess communication protocol that’s widely used in distributed systems. In the OSI model of network communication, RPC spans the transport and application layers.
