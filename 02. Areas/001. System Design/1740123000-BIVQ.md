title: What's an API?
---
API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.

At its core, an API is a **bunch of code** that takes an **input** and gives you predictable **outputs.**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7187692b-8f59-414c-8e29-b44245f3d1d5_1534x306.png)

Think of an API as a **middleman** that enables applications to interact **without needing direct access to each other's code or database**.

Almost every digital service you use today—social media, e-commerce, online banking, ride-hailing apps—all of them are a bunch of APIs working together.

**Examples:**

- **Weather API** – If you provide a city name as input (`"New York"`), the API returns the **current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions**.
- **Uber Ride API** – If you provide a **pickup and destination address**, the API finds the **nearest available driver** and calculates the estimated fare.
- **Python's** `sorted()` **API** – If you provide a list of numbers (`[5, 3, 8, 1]`), the API returns the **sorted list** (`[1, 3, 5, 8]`).

When engineers build APIs, they clearly define **what inputs the API accepts** and **what outputs it produces**, ensuring consistent behavior across different applications.

APIs follow a simple **request-response** model:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c3a0e69-9134-4bd9-9d42-a898bc838e32_1574x504.png)

- A client (such as a web app or mobile app) makes a request to an API.
- The API (hosted on an API server) processes the request, interacts with the necessary databases or services, and prepares a response.
- The API sends the response back to the client in a structured format (usually JSON or XML).

Every API requires **specific types of inputs**, and passing incorrect data can result in errors.

For example: If you tried putting your name into the Google Maps API as an input, that wouldn’t work very well.

Some APIs also **require inputs in a specific format**.

Example: The **Currency Exchange API** might need the input as `"USD_TO_EUR"` instead of `"usd to euro"`.

APIs often **validate inputs** to ensure they are correct before processing them, which helps maintain **accuracy and security**.

Just as APIs require **specific inputs**, they also return **well-structured outputs**.

For example, the **Google Maps API** always returns **coordinates in the same format**.

```
{   "latitude": 40.6892,   "longitude": -74.0445 }
```

If the API can’t find the location, it provides an error response explaining why.

```
{   "error": "Invalid address format",   "code": 400 }
```

The apps you use every day—whether it's **Gmail, Instagram, Uber, or Spotify**—are essentially **a collection of APIs with a polished user interface (UI) on top**.

Most applications follow the **frontend/backend architecture**, where:

- The **backend** consists of APIs that handle **data processing, business logic, and communication with databases**.
- The **frontend** is a **graphical user interface (GUI)** that interacts with these APIs, making applications user-friendly and accessible **without requiring users to write code**.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27d50e3c-c298-4f48-b410-d70dd6a435e3_1322x890.png)

Let’s break this down with a real-world example: **Uber**.

Before the Uber app existed as a sleek, user-friendly experience, the company first built **the core APIs that power ride-hailing services:**

- Finding Nearby Drivers
- Calculating Fares & Routes
- Process Payment
- Real-Time Tracking
- Matching Riders & Drivers

These APIs run on Uber’s servers, forming the **backend infrastructure**. Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request.

**Backend engineers** are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.

The backend APIs handle **all the complex logic**, but they **only work through code**—which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a **frontend (user interface)** on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system **visually and intuitively**.

**Example:** When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to **find nearby drivers** and displays available cars.

Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.

APIs come in different forms depending on **who can access them**, **how they are used**, and **what purpose they serve**.

Open APIs, also known as **Public APIs**, are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.

Companies provide these APIs to encourage **third-party developers** to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.

Normally, when you use the **YouTube app**, it makes **internal API calls** to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a **public API** that allows developers to access some of this functionality **outside of the app**.

For example, the **YouTube Search API** allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with `"machine learning tutorial"` as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including **titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links**.

This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.

**Internal APIs**, also known as **Private APIs**, are designed **e**xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.

Let’s take **Amazon** as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality, **multiple internal APIs** (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.

Each of these APIs **operates independently**, but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.

Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into **smaller, manageable services**, making it easier to scale. Developers can **reuse internal APIs** across different projects, reducing **duplication** and speeding up development.

The first two types of APIs we discussed—**Open APIs and Internal APIs**—are functional and serve **real-world use cases** like fetching weather data or booking a ride.

But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily: **Code Interfaces** (also called **Library APIs** or **Programming APIs**).

These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.

**Example:** Python’s built-in list API

When working with lists, Python provides a set of **built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data**.

```
numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last element
```

Instead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use `sort()` or `sorted()` in Python.

Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take **TensorFlow**, an AI/ML library. It provides a **high-level API** for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.

For example, creating a **neural network** using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:

```
import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])
```

Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.

APIs communicate using different **protocols and architectures** that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.

REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is **lightweight, stateless, and scalable**, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications.

REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.

REST APIs are based on **resources**, and each resource is accessed through a **URL (endpoint)**. The API follows the **client-server model**, meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.

**Retrieve a list of books (GET Request):**

```
GET https://api.bookstore.com/books
```

**Response (JSON):**

```
[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]
```

SOAP is an older API communication method that **relies on XML-based messaging**.

Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

SOAP messages are sent using **XML format** and require a **WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file**, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.

**Request:** Fetching account balance

```
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> 
```

**Response:**

```
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>
```

GraphQL is an alternative to REST that **allows clients to request exactly the data they need**, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can **fetch all necessary data in a single request**.

Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a **single API endpoint**, and the client sends queries to request specific fields.

```
{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }
```

Response:

```
{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }
```

gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a **high-performance API communication method** that uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.

gRPC uses **binary data format** instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports **bidirectional streaming**, meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.

Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple **request-response** pattern.

Here’s a guide on **how to find, access, and interact with an API** step by step:

Before using an API, you need to **identify the right API** for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.

**Public API directories:**

- [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) – A marketplace for APIs with free & paid options.
- [Postman API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore) – A collection of public APIs.
- [API List](https://apilist.fun/) – A fun list of free public APIs.
- [GitHub’s Public API List](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) – Open-source API collection.

**Official API Documentation:**

- [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/)
- [X API](https://developer.x.com/)
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

API documentation explains **how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats**.

**Example:** The **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3)**

The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

**API URL**

```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Required Parameters:**

- `q`: City name (e.g., `London`)
- `appid`: API Key (required for access)

Most APIs **require authentication** to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.

- **API Key -** A unique key provided by the API service
- **OAuth 2.0 -** Secure login via Google, Github, etc.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Token-based authentication
- **Basic Authentication:** Username + password (Base64 encoded)

**Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)**

- Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign\_up.
- Go to the **API keys** section and generate a key.
- Use the API key in requests:

```
GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Before writing code, **test the API** to see how it responds.

- Download & install **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)**.
- Click **"New Request"**, enter the API endpoint URL (`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`).
- Select **GET** as the HTTP method.
- Click **"Send"** and view the response in **JSON format**.

You can also test APIs directly from the **command line** using **[cURL](https://curl.se/)**.

```
curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Now that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to **integrate it into your application**.

```
import requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

- `requests.get(url)` – Sends an API request.
- `response.json()` – Converts response to JSON.
- `if response.status_code == 200` – Checks if the request was successful.

APIs **don’t always return perfect responses**. You should handle:

- **Invalid inputs** (e.g., wrong city name).
- **Authentication errors** (e.g., expired API keys).
- **Rate limits** (e.g., exceeding request limits).

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
  data = response.json()
  print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") 
elif response.status_code == 401:
  print("Error: Invalid API key") 
elif response.status_code == 404:
  print("Error: City not found")
else:
  print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")
```

Once you fetch data from an API, you can **display it dynamically in a web or mobile app**.

**Example:** You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.

- Fetch live weather data from the API.
- Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).
- Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.
